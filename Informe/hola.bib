  abstract      = {A debris flow is an erosional process that frequently occurs in areas with steep slopes. Although the initiation can be triggered in higher and inhabited altitudes, the propagation and then the deposition can endanger urbanized areas. Frequently, the zones of generation of debris flows are placed in unattainable territories complicating field observations. Moreover, the rapid vegetation’s recovery can hide the scars and tracks created by the occurrence of the flow, unlikely to be recognizable in aerial photos. As a consequence, the assessment of debris-flow susceptibility at regional scale is increasing in interest. Two main techniques can be applied for the regional susceptibility assessment: physical models and statistical models. Here, two physical models are introduced simulating the initiation of debris flow by means of shallow landslides: one based on the lateral groundwater flow and the other on vertical groundwater flow. The presented models’ algorithms are implemented in a toolbox based on GIS environment and declared as open source code. Being applied in a basin of the Spanish Pyrenees where soil properties and dataset of observations have been gathered, the two models have been evaluated. Successively, they have been compared with a statistical model based on a logistic regression. The results have been aggregated in terrain units, built as fluvio-morphological sub-catchments. Each model has been tested based on the gathered observations. It has been observed that the vertical flow-based model enhances by 18 % the performance of the lateral flow-based model in matching debris-flow susceptible areas. Furthermore, the vertical flow-based model performance is found to be similar to that of the logistic regression, having an averaged quality index of about 70 %.},

  abstract      = {ResumenAntecedentesCarbonato de lantano (CL) y clorhidrato de sevelámero (CS) son tratamientos eficaces que controlan el fósforo sérico sin los riesgos de desarrollo de enfermedad cardiovascular (ECV) asociados al aporte de calcio adicional. CL mostró mayor eficacia en la reducción del fósforo sérico (FS) que CS.ObjetivoEvaluar la relación coste-efectividad (RCEI) de CL versus CS en el tratamiento en segunda línea de pacientes dializados.MétodosSe ha diseñado un modelo de Markov considerando tres estados de salud (vivo sin ECV, vivo con ECV y muerte) que analizaba los costes (euros de 2012) y resultados en salud en pacientes dializados durante 10 años, aplicando un descuento del 3%. Los datos de eficacia se obtuvieron de un ensayo clínico de grupos cruzados que evaluaba la reducción de los niveles de FS tras el tratamiento con CL o CS en dos poblaciones de pacientes dializados: “Completer” e intención de tratar “ITT”. Las transiciones entre los distintos estados de salud se obtuvieron a partir de la literatura y de bases de datos de registros europeos y estadounidenses. Según la perspectiva del Sistema Nacional de Salud, se consideraron solamente los costes farmacológicos según precios oficiales y el coste de manejo de la ECV calculado a partir de grupo relacionado con el diagnóstico (GRD). Los beneficios se expresaron como años de vida ganados (AVG) y años de vida ajustados por calidad (AVAC). Posteriormente se realizó un análisis por subgrupos de fósforo y edad. Con el objetivo de evaluar la influencia de la variación de una serie de parámetros en los resultados del modelo y confirmar su robustez, se llevaron a cabo análisis de sensibilidad determinísticos y probabilísticos.ResultadosLos pacientes en tratamiento con CL obtuvieron 3,81 AVG (ITT) y 3,84 AVG (Completer); con CS se obtuvieron 3,79 AVG (ITT) y 3,78 AVG (Completer). El coste del tratamiento con CL fue de 18.860 € (ITT) y 18.776 € (Completer), y con CS de 18.517 € (ITT) y 18.482 € (Completer) La RCEI de CL frente a CS fue de 3.902 €/AVG y 6.306 €/AVAC (ITT); y de 2.875 €/AVG y 4.644 €/AVAC (Completer). La variable que más influyó en los resultados del análisis fue el coste del manejo del evento CV en el segundo año. Asumiendo un umbral de 30.000 €/AVAC, CL resultó ser coste-efectivo en el 99,9% de las simulaciones.ConclusionesCL es coste-efectivo frente a CS en pacientes dializados, independientemente de su edad y nivel de fósforo.AbstractBackgroundLanthanum carbonate (LC) and sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) are effective therapies controlling phosphorus levels in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing dialysis. In contrast to calcium-based binders, their usage is not associated to an increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.ObjectiveTo compare the cost-effectiveness incremental ratio (ICER) of LC versus SH as second-line therapies in dialyzed patients.MethodsA Markov model was developed considering three health states (alive without CVD, alive with CVD, dead) to assess costs (€, 2012) and outcomes with a 10-year time horizon. Yearly transitions between states were obtained from the European Dialysis and Transplant Association annual report. Efficacy data were taken from a randomized head-to-head phase 3 study performed in ESRD patients undergoing dialysis. Both ‘Intent-to-treat’ (ITT) and ‘Completer’ populations were assessed. From a Spanish healthcare service perspective, only direct costs (pharmaceutical and CVD management) were included. Medical costs (2012 prices in Euros) were obtained from diagnosis-related groups. Drug costs were derived from ex-factory prices, adjusted with 7.5% mandatory rebate. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Subgroup analyses considering age and phosphorus levels were conducted. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted.ResultsIn a 10-year projection, LC achieved 3.81 (ITT) and 3.84 (Completer) quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). With SH, 3.79 (ITT) and 3.78 (Completer) QALYs were gained. Global costs for LC therapy were €18,680 (ITT) and €18,776 (Completer), whereas for SH they were €18,517 (ITT) and €18,482 (Completer). ICERs of LC versus SH were €6,306/QALY (ITT) and €4,644/QALY (Completer). CVD management cost was the most influential parameter in the model. Assuming a €30,000/QALY threshold, LC was cost-effective compared with SH in 99.9% of PSA simulations.ConclusionsIn Spain, LC is cost-effective compared with SH for the second-line treatment of hyperphosphataemia in patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis regardless of their age and phosphorus level.},

  abstract      = {The paper focuses on the concentration of nitrates detected in superficial waters (lake and streams) and groundwater (wells) used as sources of water supply. It attempts to determine the level of risk due to the presence of urban industrial uses and correlate it with the quality of urban life, in order to determine social vulnerability to the risk of industrial contamination. A geographic information system (GIS) was constructed with layers for various census data, topographic and landuse features and the location of water samples. An index of quality of life was developed using selected variables. This was then compared to the essential services provision data and the results of the water sample analyses. The concentration of nitrates (mg/l or ppm) in the water samples was determined. These values were translated into maps of contaminants, which were then correlated with their possible sources and with the quality of life of the population affected. The concentration of nitrates in wells has been considered alarming, but more concern has been expressed about concentrations in the public water supply network. Spatial correlation between areas with high risk of contaminated water and areas with the worst quality of life, indicates the importance of controlling chemical contamination, and demands improvements in the public water supply network and revision of the theory of social vulnerability.},
